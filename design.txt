Design goals:


Work on top of CFGUI without dependencies.
Show how work was derives from generic_mapper package.

All kmap package files stored in a single place that can be version controlled (git).
    - Files stored in profileDir/kmap or kmapdata.
Configuration files stored in consistent json files so save configs can be tracked.
    - New json helpers script to help with this. 

Map in floating window (can move to another screen)

All aliases in default form of kmap object action arguments.
    - Short alias examples using expandAlias()


Map defaults to ne for up and sw for down for mapping purposes so the map is 2D by default.


Configs:

kmap mode two, one, maze
    - Sets the mode of map to connect rooms in both directions (generic_mapper normal mode), one direction (generic_mapper complex mode), or maze mode (no linking + stuff)
kmap loglevel quiet, error, info, debug, trace
    - Determines how noisy the mapper is with echos.
kmap movemethod add
kmap movemethod del
